"2","Nice addition to this part of town as a local its nice to grab some snacks on way to container park amazing desserts!!!!! love the set up !!!"
"2","I don't even know where to begin!\n\nFood, ambiance, service, atmosphere, everything was above and beyond. \n\nWe were shopping at the Union and decided to stay there for dinner. Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying. \n\nMy boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb. \n\nDrinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both. \n\nService was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it. \n\nThis is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to. They have a beautiful fire pit outside, which is perfect to have a drink by on the semi-cold Phoenix nights. \n\nThank you unique but absolutely amazing Forge and crew, we will be coming back for sure!"
"2","The New Adrenaline Bar (Formally Cheyenne Saloon) Is Keeping The Vegas Live Music Scene Alive ! ! ! ! ! \nGreat New Stage And Sound....\nGreat Drink Price's.....\nAnd Awesome Pizza.....\nCheck It Out If You Haven't And Come Back If You Used To Come Here.............."
"2","My boyfriend and stopped in for a quick breakfast, so we just got coffee and pastries from the bar. I ordered a cappuccino, maple bacon donut, and a whoopie pie. The cappuccino and donut were delicious. We didn't really like the whoopie pie- so I would skip it. It looked cute though!  Overall, the food was yummy and the place was super hip. I would totally come again."
"2","Being new to the city I am so glad I found this place. Awesome atmosphere, great people and a quality haircut to match. I'll be back again soon!"
"1","I purchased a Groupon deal for this groomer, they sold out of the small dog size deal and instead I purchased a medium size, thinking it wouldn't make a difference. I call to double check if it's ok to use this groupon to get my dog groomed when they tell me that they cannot honor it because of the fact that my dog is small and the groupon says it's for a medium-size dog. In my opinion it should not matter if I paid a little extra for medium-size groom when my dog is actually a small dog, I am very upset that I was not able to use this coupon because they made a big deal about it! I will make sure to let my contacts know to avoid this company and to go elsewhere because it doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't want to make money doing a small dog groom and me paying for a medium size groom price. It's very disappointing that they won't be getting any money from me!"
"1","This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??"
"1","This was my 4th and last foodie fest. After selling out to take casino sponsorship the new location was a complete nightmare. 45 minutes in traffic to then pay $20 a couple as we witnessed many people sneaking in free. 5 of the advertised trucks to be there were not. Foodie fest started as a local event and turned into a strip location this year. #ThankYouForRuiningThisEvent #RedDragon has to go. #Fuku and #Snowono smart enough to skip this year!"
"2","Very cool there is now a Mediterranean/Greek/Middle Eastern joint in my area. Even cooler, they have delivery service 4 miles out! This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. \n\nWhat I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. \n\nSay yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.\n\nMy other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites,Baba Ganoush,Hummus,Grape Leaves, Falafel, and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)\n\nThe Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme,sesame seeds, and ..I forget..but whatever it is, I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him, he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. \n\nThe Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef, Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. \n\nThe only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. \n\nThey did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8, Cino's, Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) \n\nPrice for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there, there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch/dinner rotation. Imma Fan!!! Four Stars!"
"1","Been to the Biltmore location many times but my wedge salad was drowning in dressing, the food took WAY too long to come out and I took a bite of my son's burger and almost had to spit it out. The banana cream pie was great but that graham cracker crust needs a hammer & chisel to get through.\nLove the wide open location!\nOverall, much too pricey for what you (don't ) get."
"2","I got the classic but upgrades to the Kobe which was so tender and off the hook juicy and amazing.  Very cool place, open and trendy.  Had a really cool feel.  I also got the banana pie which was off the hook deliciously. Definitely highly recommend this place for a gourmet burger, best in Gilbert for sure!"
"2","We just left and will go back for burgers anytime we are in the mood.\n\n5 minute wait for a table is not shabby for Saturday. \n\nService was speedy and personable. \n\nSplit the Carmel milkshake with the wife and it was worth it.  I did not share my burger with her, as she pointed out to me after I was finished.  She enjoyed her burger and the fries. Both were cooked spot on temp wise and super juicy and tasty. \n\nShe said the best burger she can recall and I second that."
"2","We have been to this location at least ten times, so obviously we are fans.  We have tried almost every burger on the menu at least once.  We have also sampled all of the side offerings.  We always order a Zucchini fries (with a side of the Truffle Aioli that comes with the truffle fries).  I am generally not a fan of vegetables disguising themselves as fries, but these are amazing.  Also, I am generally not a fan of $10.00 burgers and was pre-disposed to not like this place.  However, the burgers here are phenominal.  We can usually split one burger and one side (usually the green chile fries, but sometimes we venture out and try one of the others) and it is plenty for two of us (this is in addition to the aforementioned Zucchini fries, of course).  Our favorites are the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple (I even splurged once and got the Kobe style Plain and Simple - it was very good, but not good enough to justify the extra cost on a regular basis).  The onions on the Zinburger are braised in Zinfandel and very tasty.  Although I have not tried the Turkey burger, I have been told by several folks that have tried it that it is the best one they have tasted.  Flavorful and juicy.  \nYou should always find out what the burger of the day is - we have had some pretty amazing ones.\nThe shakes are also phenominal (although I prefer beer, I have tasted at least six different flavors of shakes and they were all outstanding).\nThe staff is great.  Very pleasant and generally attentive.  We did have one incident where our server apparently walked oof after taking our drink orders, but once the management was made aware they were on top of it immediately (and stayed on top of it throughout our stay).  The management staff is very friendly and they are always walking around checking things out and making small talk with the patrons.\nAll in all, for a higher end burger place, this is a very good choice (we can usually get out for under $30.00 for the two of us if it isn't Happy Hour - even less during HH).  This is propably my favorite place in Old Town Gilbert."
"2","Second time here, first time wasn't super impressed but I think it's because we were comparing it to Hot n Juicys. If you want a trifeca sauce, I'd recommend HNJ... the trifeca sauce here is a little too oily and not juicy at all so it doesn't penetrate the shells. However this time we went with the waiters suggestion... PACIFIC RIM sauce. OH SO YUMMY! that was so delicious... Highly recommend"
"2","Finally found a great breakfast place close to home. Great service too! Real corn beef and hash and banana nut French toast....yummo."
"1","THIS HOTEL IS A HORROR!  I find it hard to believe that anyone who has ever stayed at a hotel before, (anywhere & any rating all the way from the Holiday Inn to the Four Seasons), would write a positive review for this spot.\n\nI have nothing but negative things to say...\nI will elaborate when I check out. But for the time being I will say that the worst part is that I paid & furthermore splurged on this, my vacation...something I haven't done in years.  It also happened to be my bday & it was ruined by the unprofessisonal and imcompetance of the linq-i missed a bday dinner, a concert and worst of all-good times & memories...ultimately, all this was was money & time flushed down the drain. They didnt take accountability either & blammed hotels.com...i have photos/videos/& record from hotels.com as documentation to prove this to be true. \nThe one star I gave is for brooklyn bowl, otherwise if yelp allowed for it, i wouldn't give one at all.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe entire day I've called to request a blanket that every other room has on their bed. I spoke with someone more then 5x. Each time they either ignored or forgotten about my request OR are they are actually incompetant, which I'm starting to believe to be the reason.\n\nA pool is advertised, there is no pool. It is under construction. \n\nThe room service only operates from 7AM-1PM. \n\nElevators are for the most part broken & don't always run...best option is to use the stairs. \n\nMANAGMENT IS COMPLETELTY UNQUALIFIED TO OVERSEE A HOTEL & WITH THAT, A NEW HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS...ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR  DESTINATION SPOTS IN THE WORLD.  I FEEL LIKE THEY OWE ME $ FOR WASTING MY VACATION TIME, THEIR FALSE ADVERTISING, INABILITY TO ACCOMADATE & UNHOSPITALITY.\n\nDon't bother booking anything but a standard room because they ignore requests and will put u in a standard room, which I'm assuming is all they really have...\n\nHORRIBLE.  DON'T LET THIS HOTEL STEAL YOUR MONEY."
"1","The place stinks of smoke like when it was the Imperial. The rooms are tiny. The WIFI works about half the time or less. The casino area is small, the only saving grace is the staff are attentive.\nThe bars and restaurants on the walk way are all nice."
"1","Hmmm let's see , we have a reservation a Guys and of course the husband wanders off. I stop and ask where he is heading the casino. I shrug like whatever I'll wander with the kiddos. Turn to walk away to get stopped by svete the rentacop. No kids in the casino!  Oh no I reply we are going to the restaurant . No you and the kids have to go outside.  I'm like ... Whaa?  The hotel is jammed packed with children walking the same areas no one is in the casino so why can't we go to the restaurant?  No children must wait outside. It's in the 30s and we are guests seriously? .  Husband runs back like no no I won't gamble, we'll just walk on. No children need to go outside. That's where I'm about done . I ask him if he realizes we are guests and it's freezing and since hubs is there he's is like oh no you can walk on. Seriously ?? I go to management and yep his name was Carlos Santana (total double take) he agrees it's cold and if the kids were able to move on it shouldn't be a problem. But outside is completely illogical especially when it's cold. Regardless this place has left a bad taste in my mouth. The amount of people complaining before me should have given me a clue at the quality of service.  Staying at the Cosmo"
"1","I DON'T RECOMMEND STAYING IN LINQ HOTEL IN VEGAS. First of all, you come to your room around 3 am and construction starts around 6 am.. It's a loud freaking noise like they are digging or drilling asphalt constantly. It's very loud and annoying. Second, your phone doesn't work In this big building, it's 21th century and phone doesn't work. That's so stupid. Third, if you ask for extra blanket, they only give per person. Their none working Wifi that keeps dropping is limited to two device and for each extra device you have to pay $13... stupid.. If my own phone was working in their vicinity then I had less problem but your phone doesn't work so we used our two device limit for me and my husband's phone so we couldn't even connect our iPads or laptops because was stupid to pay $13.99 box extra for each device... The casino has no good ventilation and it's like you are walking in a smoke room. There is no central air condition unit in the room and it's loud like the one in old motels...Anyhow for the price we paid I could have stayed in a 4 star hotels but we decided to stay here given that it was a newer  built but that was mistake."
"2","I'm part of the Phoenix-area comedy scene and we were given the opportunity to practice our bits every Sunday night.  We did one show in the Upstairs room and most of the comedians bombed on stage because everyone's ADD kicked in when they saw all of the things hanging on the walls and ceiling.  Sometimes that happens with people in new rooms who are less experienced in comedy (like me), but it was insane watching even the most experienced comedians do poorly at that show.  With that being said, it didn't work out the way we wanted to and we're not allowed back in, but I have no hard feelings and I hope they give us another shot.\n\nAnyway, 5-stars because this place is amazing.  Beautiful patio outside of the building, and then you walk in and the further you trek, the weirder and wilder it gets!  You think to yourself \""hey, can it get weirder than this?\""  Oh yes it can!  And it does from the very moment you take your first step upstairs....I can't even explain the upstairs room.  You need to check it out if you want your mind to be blown to pieces.  \n\nI wish I could talk about the food, but I got here at 10pm when the kitchen closes, so make sure you get earlier if you want food on a Sunday.\n\nIt's too bad we can't do comedy here anymore because it's such a fun room!  We're sorry we weren't funny enough for Minder Binders."
"2","Love this place! This is a new location that is in a perfect place for me by the mall. The people are always welcoming and remembered me after I came in a few times in a week because I can't get enough!! Their sauce is the best. My friends and I meet there on a regular basis now. :) Thank you canes!!"
"1","Ordered delivery, they forgot half of the order. \nTried to call them to TELL them that half my order was missing - they didn't answer. Had to call 20 times until they picked up. \nAnd the food wasn't worth the price. \nSMALL portions, lacking flavor, not fresh ingredients."
"1","If you don't mind or are used to being treated like you really don't matter or just another patient, this is certainly the place to go to.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but the woman in scrubs at check in this afternoon 10/21/2014  was very smug and  had a scowled look on her face.  I was going to use Dr. Stein to perform a preventive screening colonoscopy and was told I would not be meeting him until right  before the procedure.  Seems to me that if you are going into the doctors office to set up the procedure and paying the specialist insurance copay you would at least meet the doctor before.  I really felt like they cared less about me personally and also my business.  Guess they have enough business looking at the parking lot and waiting room.  I decided not to use them and opted to use someone a little more personable and caring.  This place looks like it is run like a production line, herd em in and herd em out."
"1","Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \""but I have your food here, do you not want it?\"". One of my friends stated \""Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\"". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional."
"1","As chains go there is certainly a problem with the new location chosen for this franchise.  Should you wish to dine here on an evening or a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, finding a parking space in the parking lot will be impossible  Apparently the Holiday Inn Express has commandeered the entire parking lot for their Hotel and the parking lot is \""empty\"".  As for the staff, other than letting me know that Holiday Inn will tow my car, there is no other help to dine at their franchise.  It is hard to sample the food when you have no way to park your car safely or within 600' or their door."
"2","Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience."
"1","I tried this location again. I really like the concept, but the execution is so bad. \n\nThere was no one ordering ahead of us and not too many people already seated when I got there early on a Sunday evening for four sandwiches to go. Given that I live less than 5 mins away, I went ahead and ordered the sandwiches hot. \n\nRookie mistake. If WW had a system where all sandwiches were ready at/near the same time, I could have made it home with four hot sandwiches. Place order, wait 7/10 mins and first order is called. Several minutes later two sandwiches go to a previously sat table. Several minutes later two more of my sandwiches. Long wait, two items to people who ordered after me. Then my last sandwich. So, 10 or more mins after my first sandwich, we received our last one. Of course, sandwich one is pretty much cold by then. \n\nI don't understand how their system is customer friendly. Even if you eat in, who wants to sit and stare at their food for 10 minutes while the rest of the table waits?  I have seen this all three visits. \n\nDone with Which Wich unless maybe I'm alone, starving and it's the only place around."
"2","I was so happy that Passion8 relocated to Elizabeth. I finally get to experience the flavors for myself. The new location is sleek and minimal, with lots of wood. Our meal was terrific. Delicious oysters, charcuterie to start, with the fish of the day and quail for our mains.  All included wonderful combinations of interesting flavors. We will definitely make this one of our regular places."
"2","This is probably the best toy store I've been - there is a large range of toys, however, it seems geared more toward adults and older children.\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in locked cases and the best part, the huge wall of Funko Pop vinyl figures! These are adorable vinyl figures of popular television, movie, and real life characters that have been shrunk down and paired with disproportionally large heads. Prior to The Toy Box, I would purchase these vinyl figures on Amazon (if available). Although most of the prices are higher compared to Amazon, it's nice to see them in person and there are many figures that are hard to find online. They seem to range in price depending on their popularity, but they start around $10.\n\nThey have a nice Yelp check-in offer of 15% off one item, so don't forget to utilize it!"
"2","Good location for tempe marketplace. Far away from all the craziness and traffic aka much easier to get to than bevmo. Other than that it's your typical total wine. The second I walked in a staff member asked me if he could help me find something, and when they didn't have what I was looking for he redirected me to something similar. He knew what he was talking about, and even gave me a little lesson in champagne- Rose to be exact."
"2","Lots of TVs to watch games. They have local beers, which is great! Lots of seating. Looks way better then the iguana Mack. Serves is alright not bad but not amazing. Chili atmosphere"
"1","Like the other reviewers, we have had a horrible time trying to make an appointment.  After complaining to Groupon, we were able to finally set an appointment.  What a surprise, they never showed up!    Maybe the common theme is, crappy service for Groupon customers?"
"2","Great new spot in the Bethany neighborhood. Great games and cocktails, like it's sister bar Little Woody's!"
"2","Love the location especially when the ice skating rink is up and running. Sitting on the patio is pretty chill watching all the people happily skating around. Every time I have come for happy hour drinks with or without snacks, there is some kind of hassle ordering-- can't find wine, or glasses or how to ring it up on cash register, but I keep coming back because it is  a relaxing place to hang out without a ton of creeps--- it is what is is and for the most part it is just fine."
"1","Wait to go here. They do not have the ability to handle a Friday night. Had reservations for 730. Left at 815. Not once did a manager come out to explain or apologize. Hopefully they will figure it out."
"2","Wanted to try a new spot and was recommended to try out Hearthstone by a friend. Great decor and energy. Especially loved the food! Must haves on the menu are the  Steak Tartare, Deviled eggs, Charred Octopus and the Charcuterie! Enjoy!"
"1","Oh boy, where to start..  The wagyu beef burger - seriously, that is not.  It was a perfect copy of In-n-out. \n\nThree hours to get through dinner.  There is a big disconnect between the look of the place and the end result.  Needs a kitchen manager bad.  \n\nNot gonna be back. No way.  The staff was friendly, service was fair, but we waited a very long time for the \""American\"" styled tapas.  \n\nA few sparks of potential, but the team just could not pull it off. \n\nI lament spending $21 for an In-n-Out burger. When my wife leaned over and said; \""Nice cafeteria burger...\"" I knew this was not gonna end well, and it didn't. \n\nUgh."
"1","I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.  \n\nTo be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told \""of course, we aren't THAT restaurant\"".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.\n\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same. \n\nI ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.\n\nThe entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \""ok\"".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding. \n\nThe owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park."
"1","Went here just to get a slice of peppermint pie since a friend posted a picture of it on facebook.\n\nThe service was super friendly and fast.  The pie was just okay though, I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to it.  Two slices of pie were small (though very rich) and the price was crazy expensive for to-go.  I believe $4.50 per small slice?\n\nI can't imagine I would ever go back..."
"1","I have to give Burger 21 only two stars for a couple of reasons. First, service. Despite there being at least 15 staff members, service was slow. My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is."
"1","First visit to Burger 21. Ordered the Burger 101 and onion strings to go. The onion strings were so heavily coated with salt I could not even eat them. The burger was very salty as well and did not finish it. Very disappointed and will not return."
"1","This is a typical B scale hotel lobby restaurant. Nothing special.\n\nAt lunch, they have a \""flatbread buffet\"". It sounded good, but since I was the only person that was eating lunch at the restaurant, the flatbread was over an hour old and dried up under the heat lamps. They were not going to put fresh out since I was the only customer.\n\nThe salad bar was ok, but VERY limited (14 items total)."
"2","As a 20 year resident of Scottsdale, I remember this location being a pottery shop for the longest time.\n\nIt's nice to see them redevelop the building into a cozy Mexican restaurant.  The patio and outside bar are good areas to enjoy a meal when the weather is nice.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and I enjoyed my skirt steak rice bowl with stewed beans.  The flavors and the different sauces that you can add make for a nice option without the heavy sauces and cheese that come on dishes at most Mexican restaurants.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return."
"2","First time tonight.  Loved it. Good food. Had the trio dip combo with the chips. The salsa bowl was delicious as were the other two dips which were. Avocado and quesa. Good service. Nice burrito and salads. Patio is great looking , fire coming out of the pedestals was a very classy touch.  Great outdoor furniture. We ate inside. Comfortable booth, well padded. And booth area was more quiet than the bar area which was very noisy. Awesome restrooms, great decor  good service. Great parking.  Should be a big hit. Is a little expensive compared to some simple Mexican places,  they also charged $5 for a salsa refill. Which is free at most Mex places."
"2","Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. \nThe menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!\nThey serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. \nGreat ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!"
"1","Paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant is absolutely ridiculous, especially when nothing was that good. Maybe they charge because its in the heart of yuppy Myers Park. Tacos were at most ok. Margaritas were overpriced and not good. Service was ok. Don't waste your time with this place as there are way better Mexican places in Charlotte."
"1","So after being seated, we asked the hostess what appetizers we could get pretty quickly and she named 2 and that was great. Once our waitress arrived we ordered drinks, the waitress brought us water and our drinks and came back for our orders a minute or two later. We ordered the calamari and 4 dishes. The calamari came first about 10 minutes later, then bread. The calamari was pretty disappointing, the calamari itself was kind of watery tasting. After we were almost done with the app, the waitress brought some bread and oil, which was very tasty - we had a few servings! Then came the salads. I personally really liked the salad and the house Italian dressing, but it is very Rosemary based, which some may not like.\n\nThen came our entrees. I got the scarpariello dish with a side of pasta - I really liked the sausage but the chicken was kind of meh. My friends had: bolognese, pesto, and puttanesca. It seems like the puttanesca was a win from the crowds reactions, but the others were also meh. It sounds fancy (naming) but I could've made the same thing at home easily. \n\nMy main complaint is the order of food. I've worked in an Italian restaurant before, you always bring the bread first! Especially if the waitress is busy the hostess should go grab some bread ASAP. Then salads, then apps, then entree. To be fair it seemed like the hostess was new. \n\nDoubtful I'd go again for $15/entree mediocre food and service."
"1","DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe worst possible customer service I have ever received. \n\nSo, I was told to get an ecig from this place by someone who had recently bought one from them. Been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too. \nSo, I went to the kiosk they have set up at AZ Mills Mall. I talked to the guy working there. We discussed what would work best for us and talked about prices. The one he was selling me was their most basic model. He told me they are normally $85 but would sell me 2 of them for $80. He said their juices are normally $10 but would sell me some for $5 each. And in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaced sometimes. I wanted to get a bunch of those since I have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted him to have plenty and not run out. So he told me since I was buying in bulk he would give them to me for $2.99 each instead of $5.99 each. \n\nI purchased the stuff, totaling out to $120.00. \n\nThe next day, I decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didn't have at the kiosk. I see my ecig I just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didn't have at the kiosk. AND TO MY SURPRISE, they were only $20 a piece on the website. Yes, you read that right. He charged me DOUBLE the price that they sell it for online. This is a LOCAL, SMALL company. I completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view, touch and check a product out in person. But DOUBLE the price????? The liquids are only $5 online and the heating elements are only $1.99. So, once again, got charged more and ripped off there too. \n\n*****Don't worry, the story gets better still*****\n\nSo, I call the kiosk number listed on my receipt. I ask to speak to a manager.  I get Frank on the phone and I tell him my situation. His response was (very rudely with tons of attitude in his voice) \""And what does that have to do with me?\"" Excuse me? You are the manager, same company, etc. He told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail. Um. Bullshit. But ok. So I asked him if I should call the online customer support. Again, very, very rudely he replies \""You can do whatever you want.\"" WOW! I then proceeded to tell him how much he sucks at doing his job. \n\nSoooooo, I call the main phone number listed on the website. *Ring, ring....* \""Hello?\""  Yes, a company listing this number online for a business answers the phone Hello, not the company name. So I asked if this was Vapor Tech, he tells me yes. So, I proceed to tell him about being charged double, blah, blah. He explains that online, you don't get a lifetime warranty and at stores you do. So, I get charged double the price because I get a lifetime warranty? A lifetime warranty for a company that most likely won't be around that long, but ok. \n\nNow, here's the real kicker. So, online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for $40. But I paid that price for 1 because I get a lifetime warranty, right? WELL, the funny part is, if you try to use that lifetime warranty, there is a restocking fee of $19.99. So, for $60, I could buy 3 ecigs online, but instead, I get 1 at the kiosk for $40, then if it breaks I have that awesome lifetime warranty, but I have to pay $20 restocking fee???????????????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \n\nSo, continuing, this guy I'm talking to is the owner of the company. And then I tell him about his rude manager at the kiosk. Yeah, he doesn't give 2 shits. He tells me if I buy any liquids online to let him know and he'd throw a few bottles in there free for me. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and call BULLSHIT right now. If he wanted to resolve the situation, he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me. \n\nHORRIBLE, SCAM, PRICE GOUGING, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"1","I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy. \n\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that \""he didn't show up for work\"" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he \""might be to busy to take us\"". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \n\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \n\nI booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again, very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.  \n\nUmmm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book."
"2","first time here and we will be back.  We tried a bunch of tacos and they were all great.   The tortillas were fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy.  I liked the cactus one the best.  They told us they will be adding more to the menu soon we we can't wait to back and try them too."
"2","I had a great brunch with my 6 relatives here recently. The atmosphere was great. Parking was easy, back dirt lot, and the service was excellent. It was a bit more pricey than I thought it would've been but overall I had a great experience.  The traditional Mexican meals were good and their specialty drinks were excellent. Don't rack too many of those up though cause it's costly! I'm a fan."
"2","Very satisfied customer so far. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Special thanks to the owner for my free tea!"
"2","Saw that this place opened up right across the street from my house and it was much needed.  We have a pizza hut, but there is nothing like coal oven pizza, it's the best.  I haven't had the pizza yet, but I have had their wings and OMG they are perfect.  I had the Italian style wings which are marinated over night (from what they told me) and they were cooked to perfection.  This is my new place for football and fun."
"2","Yum!  They have huge rolls that are just delectable.  A bit pricey and I wasn't as impressed with the non-sushi entrees.  However, the sushi is awesome!\n\nI would recommend getting an appetizer and just jumping straight into the sushi heaven."
"1","Service terrible - hostess was rude and took forever to get a waitress, the menu is not appropriate for children - many menu names X RATED. \nThe atmosphere is beautiful dark woods and reds. If they paid as much attention to their food and their customers as they did the decor, it would be a 10."
"1","Well we went and tried it and not my favorite. I've been to many places in Las Vegas for sushi and this one did not hit its mark. Two things high prices that are not justified and service was so so. Never brought our edamame we ordered and put it on the bill. Rolls were extremely generic. Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly, it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab, avo, and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back. Many other sushi places to try in Vegas for better food and service."
"2","It might be my first check in but I've been here three times already. This time I brought my boyfriend with me.\n\nThey have a wide range of flavors when it comes to milktea, tea or snow bubble (my personal favorite). Lychee is usually my go to flavor but I have also tried their passion fruit which was delicious. They can also mix flavors for you like caramel thai tea snow bubble that my boyfriend asked for. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and easy to talk to. The price is very reasonable. You get a drink for under $5! \n\nOverall, this spot definitely satisfies my boba cravings:)"
"2","Great new local Italian spot in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our dinner and the place looks great! We are giving them a -1 star for the service which was good but pretty slow. It's only their second day being open so I'm sure it will get better. Anyhow, the food and drinks were great. We shared the grilled octopus, the caprese 3 way, and the bolognese and finished with the chocolate dessert. Very yummy and we will be back!"
"1","I hate to be the odd man out but the previous revues must have been friends of the owner.  The Bolognese lacked flavor and the pasta was gummy and stuck together in a clump.  The Spiga salad advertised salami and pancetta\nAnd if there was one ounce of meat in it I could not find it.  My calamari was inedible and looked like it came from the frozen food case at Safeway. The dipping sauce with it was flavorless.\nOn the plus side the space is great with a good vibe.  If you go for vibe and space go, if you go for good food go somewhere else.  A generous 2 stars.\nAs usual North Scottsdale people confuse with flash with real quality cuisine. The I noticed that several great reviews that were the first ever in yelp, obviously planted by friends of the owner.  By the way the server agreed the calarmi  was terrible and removed it from my check"
"2","Great menu. Pasta was delicious. Pizza flavor was excellent but unfortunately crust became very soggy fast. Will definitely be back."
"2","Stopped in and had their pad Thai along with some Thai tea. Everything was very good and very fresh. It's a little on the lighter side, which was refreshing. Their coconut ice cream is amazing. 10/10 for Thai food in the area."
"2","Tried phuket Thai for the first time, my wife had the lunch special green curry, still ended up with enough leftover for another lunch.  I asked if they had any whole fish dishes, the owner made an off menu pompano fish in red curry.  The ginger tea and Thai coffee were tasty and we finished with homemade coconut ice cream.  Bring cash and save 10%.  Quantity and quality were good, service was a little slow."
"1","This decision isn't one that I'm happy about. As a first time patron at the Culinary Dropout, I have to say, I will not be returning not because of the food (by the way, the food was OUTSTANDING) but because of the our waitress. On a Friday night, one could expect to have a delay in being seated, having orders taken...but to wait 45 minutes for your drink to arrive after already waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to acknowledge our table, is ridiculous! On top of waiting, a lady in our group asked for her drink three times, in which the waitress walked away twice while the request was being made....I mean who does that? Oh and by the way, never ONCE was I offered a refill on my Diet Coke during the 2+ hours of being there. \n\nNow on to the food, as stated above, the food is outstanding, however, due to our waitress not bringing our food out in a timely manner, my steak was cold. By this time, I had enough of the service issues and just wanted OUT. \n\nThe check arrives, and lone behold, it's wrong...waitress fixes the check, and proceeds to cash us out...our total bill for two is a little over $60, I hand the waitress a $100, and should have received $41.36 back in change....guess what, the waitress returns $41 and no change. So needless to say, your waitress should be thankful she kept the $.36 in change because that's $.35 more than what she was going to get from me. \n\nI honestly hope the Culinary Dropout reviews this and either contacts me for more information  before this waitress is allowed to ruin what could be an amazing experience for others."
"2","This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!"
"2","I am so happy to have MTO Caf\u00e9 open in Downtown Summerlin.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.\n\nI was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the \""Philly\"" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.\n\nThe menu describes it this way.  \""Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.\""  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.\n\nI selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.  \n\nThe small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.  \n\nAfter finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!"
"2","The MTO cafe is another great addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. In door and patio dining are available. The indoor space is brightly lit and has comfortable seating. Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people.\nFood preparation is not fast delivery food but made to order. After our food was delivered a staff member returned to check on our satisfaction.  \nTh Rueben sandwich was an ample size and comes with pickles on the side and skinny fries. The sandwich was juicy and tender. The special sauce is fantastic. A nice rye bread complements the sandwich.\nThe BLT sandwich was huge. Very tasty and half was taken home. This sandwich also comes with skinny fries that are soft inside, firm outside and not greasy.\nMTO serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu has many choices that we look forward to experiencing on future visits."
"2","Great store with good discounts on quality products."
"1","I had RAIU done at Dobson Imaging earlier this week (Tuesday morning). The tech there said Chandler Endo would have my results by the end of the day. Today, *Friday*, Christine called at 1115 and left a message for me to call back before noon as the phones were being turned off for the weekend. I called at 1125 (which is, last I heard, before noon) and left a VM. And 1150. And 1155. 1156. 1157. 1158. Guess who never called me back.\n\nIf the practice is too busy to efficiently handle their patients, then they need to stop taking referrals and unf*ck their system. I'll be giving my GP an earful and demanding a referral to a different endocrinologist on Monday.\n\nEDIT, 10 July: Dr Belitsky somehow missed that my thyroid is 3x larger than normal, crammed full of nodules, and producing no, as in  less than 0.01mg/dL, TSH. This is beyond malpractice and into butt-monkey incompetence. I've since transferred to Endocrinology Associates, who (whom?) I'll be reviewing later."
"2","Had the grilled pork and also shewn beef sandwiches.... This restaurant has a great atmosphere, fantastic food and great service! Awesome new addition. I will be eating here often. Come try it out."
"1","Terrible bloody mary that took ten minutes to get. Service was slow, watched manager come out and apologize multiple times to dissatisfied customers.  Food was mediocre at best.   Beautiful building and decor is the only thing this place has to offer."
"1","We went there a couple of days ago for dinner. The place was fairly busy but we got a nice table soon enough. \nThe ambience and the food presentation was great, however, the service was not good at all. They also took a really long time to prepare our food and then brought out the appetizers and entrees together!! The food tasted alright, however, was not worth the wait."
"2","Consistently adding value to already invaluable services. I am always surprised to see something new and awesome added."
"2","BEE-ARR-GEE-ARR has revolutionary gourmet burgers. \nAbout 20 beers on tap.\nCocktails.\nHandmade shakes and more.\nOrdered the Button Buster with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar, bearnaise ailol, onion rings.  Tasty and nice combo of flavors.  Had the BRGR fries tossed with parmesan + herbs.  Nice tasty and firm fries.  Tried some of the fries with the mayo based BRGR condiment, just like they do in many European countries and found that to be an interesting, too!\n\nThe manager was stopping at all the tables to check on how everything was.  \n\nIt's good to have BRGR in the area."
"1","Wanting to try the new place, we went around noon on a Sunday, place was less than half full, so no waiting.  We ordered and our burgers came surprisingly quickly.  You would think they would be piping hot.  But, no, they were just warm.  Had they been pre-cooked?  It was curious.  We ordered the Cajun tots and an order of fries.  The burgers were pretty tasteless, not juicy, which only added to our thoughts that they may have been pre-cooked.  Fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices, not enough to earn the Cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.  Personally, I think that if you are at the Galleria and want a burger, the burgers at Houlihans are better.  Also, and this may seem petty, but I hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.  We won't bother going back, we felt the same way about the BRGR in East Liberty.  Too bad, I was hoping for a success at that location, it has been through a few iterations of restaurants."
"1","The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable , but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft"
"2","Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.\n\nShared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.\n\nWe will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations."
"2","I love this place. So suprised that there are any negative reviews. Weather is cold now and this place has great comfort food. Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. My family and I eat here at least once a week."
"2","What a welcome addition to the neighborhood full of yummy food choices!  There are so many options, each burger is as original as you!   If you are up to the challenge, may I suggest their 20oz burger!   With a mountain of fresh toppings, each bite is a new experience!  If you finish it and the fries......you become a legend on their wall of fame.  Over 50 ingredients to create the perfect shake, you just can't go wrong here!    Bring an appetite and perhaps a bib, you won't be disappointed!"
"2","Amazing burger, amazing shakes would recommend. Also pretty decent service I will be back"
"1","Oh where to begin...  When we first arrived we were seated quickly in a too tight dining area.  My husbands chair was up against another customers chair.  There is no way to maneuver to get to your table so forget getting up to go to the bathroom because you will disrupt the diners around you.  We started w/3 waters with lemon.  Our server brought the waters .... no lemon.  We had to remind him twice to bring the lemon.   \n\nThe 1/3lb burger is tiny at best, the meat is about the size of a slider but the bun is a regular size burger bun.   A Mcdonald's cheeseburger from their dollar menu is bigger.   So I ordered a classic burger w/mayo/let/mushrooms cooked medium, My daughter had a classic burger cooked medium well w/mayo/let  only.  My husband ordered the pounder and he ordered the \""best of both\"" with fries and onion rings.   My daughter and I opted to share a med. fries only.   \n\nMy burger arrived w/no mushrooms, my daughter's burger was blood rare and we did not get the fries we ordered.  The \""best of both\"" was mediocre at best.  The breading used on the onion rings has no flavor and tastes blah so they probably only use flour on them without any type of  seasonings.  My husbands fries were heavily coated w/pepper and appeared old so he didn't even eat them.  \n\nI did send both mine and my daughters burger back to be fixed.   It took a while for the food to be returned, I also did inquire about the missing order of fries.  The server said \""oh sorry\"" I guess I forgot to order them.   So about 15 mins. later and my daughter and I had finished our mini me burgers, we received fresh hot fries that had not been seasoned at all which was probably a good thing because at least they were edible, but again nothing special.    So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone!!  It's also kind of pricey.   I received better service and tastier food at Smash burger and it's only a block further.   I will travel the extra block.   \n\nThis place may do better on the strip especially considering their higher prices and visitors would probably flock to it's doors not knowing any better.  But as local, it's definitely worth my time to drive somewhere where I will get better service and food for my money!!"
"2","So we have been driving by the one on Rainbow in southwest for about a year now and saw this newly opened gem while we were getting our pictures taken near by. While we waited for the pictures to print, we decided to try this place. The food was pretty good and the service was fantastic. Definitely  worth a visit."
"1","The food was good be service was very slow. We ordered a shake waited 15 mins before we learned the main ingredient was out of stock. Our food made it to the table still no shake since we changed the shake order. A table was sat near us was never greeted got tired of waiting they left without eating at all. At the end we sat just waiting to pay so we could leave over all not a good experience may not go back."
"1","1. Decor of a 50's diner. \n2.  Riff raff clientele \n3. Took forever to get waited on. \n4. Another eon to get the food. \n5. Young portly tattooed waiter obviously didn't know what he was doing. \n6. Salad ordered by my wife.  How can you screw up a salad?  Well, some lettuce leaves had brown spots, that's how. \n7. Sweet potato fries had been sitting for awhile before being served, kinda soggy. \n8. Make up your own burger.  So I did, so maybe it was my fault it tasted like some fool had put it together. \n9.  Is there a minus star rating?"
"1","Watered down milkshakes, the place smells like the nail salon next door, Egg Cream was EXTREMELY small along with too much soda. Liked the fry seasoning but they were under cooked.  Long wait time for our food. Given the burger competition on Eastern Ave., the space will be vacant by Summer."
"2","My second time here and the food is very consistent. .the prices are great the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. .must stop in"
"1","Went to the outlet mall in search of a cafe that was nowhere to be found. One of the mall's finest recommended Steak and Fries and raved about it. I guess you can't blame a guy for talking up the very place he is paid to protect, but this place was not good. At best it was fast food quality at restaurant prices in a food court. \n\nThey were not busy by any stretch, but had six cackling employees behind the counter carrying on like geese in heat. Their mating calls could be heard echoing throughout the food court. \n\nThe food took too long and my bacon cheeseburger was just \""middle of the road.\"" The fries were decent, but only warm. I was expecting hot, fresh fries. No such luck. Lunch for two was thirty bucks! There were a few other options inside the food court but you might be better off leaving the property for lunch if this place is any indication of how the other eateries are.\n\nOnly two stars this go round. The service, food quality and price all combined to make this a disappointing experience."
"1","Dang I wish I knew this was on Yelp. I would save the time and money.\nI am a hardcore JFK fan. my license plate is JFK! and boy was I disappointed.\nEverything is a replica, items are scattered in a huge meeting/ event room, it looks so amateurish I felt like it was disrespectful to the 35th president. \nEven if it was free admission I'd still be disappointed and upset. \nI could have done a better job doing it in my living room. \nShame on you Tropicana!"
"1","I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now after seeing it featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The star of the show was the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Which on the show, looked amazing.  The chili cheese fries were made with copious amounts of oxtail and was a meal in itself.   I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.  That's the same price as a burger!"
"2","I expected this location to be similar to the one in PHX: underwhelming and overpriced. However!!! I experienced something much better.  It just seems a bit more quant..put together..and a place that encourages interaction between  guests and invites you to truly enjoy yourself.Maybe its just the new place...the layout (additional bar outside) or the low key yet swanky atmosphere....\nI'm not totally sure. This place deserves the hype."
"2","Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\""/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"
"2","This was my first Yelp Elite event and my first chance to meet Risa, as well as some other great people! What a warm, lively, fun, creative and delicious way to spend a chilly Sunday night! \nI'm going to try to write this review without using too many exclamation marks, but that'll be a challenge. \nDanielle, the glowing hostess, was on fire in the kitchen! I mean, she whipped up individual stir fry plates for every single guest (and there were a lot of us), hot and beautifully presented. And, THOSE PEANUTS. Seriously - I don't even really like peanuts but I was even grabbing a handful on my way out the door despite being already painfully full. Where were they from again?? Also, it'd been a while (like many, many years) since I'd had tempeh, and I now feel like I've been missing out! I'm definitely going to go back to check out Noble Bean, our tempeh supplier for the night, housed just upstairs from Cuisine Culinaire. Who knew?! Now we do. \nInstead of waiting in line for stir fry, I decided to go to dessert first and sample some of the cookies brought in for the swap... and really didn't even know where to begin with those... There were sooooo many good cookies and such a variety. Thankfully I had my partner with me so that I could just take a bite of one to sample it and hand off the rest to him to finish for me. Ha! Cookies for days. What a FABULOUS idea to have a cookie swap. Everybody got to leave with something. :)\nNow, Cuisine Culinaire is one of over a thousand community kitchens in Quebec, so we were told, and this blows my mind! Quebec wins! It's really good to know about this place, and I hope they have a website, because it would be awesome to go back for a cooking class sometime!"
"2","I'm in love with this adorable little shop! It's PERFECT! Something for everyone, you'll never leave empty-handed! The owners are warm and friendly and so helpful!"
"2","'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the QC, Yelpers were celebrating - more American Mules for you and for me!\n\nThank you IOS for hosting such an awesome Yelp holiday party! Nikki W has done it again! Thank you to Poprock for catching really fun moments, your pictures always depict the fun environment perfectly! (#alloftheexclamationmarks)\n\nThis was such a fun event!  I completely fell in love with the American Mule cocktail, and the punch was delicious too. The food line was long, but worth it. Everything was made just right, and the lamb was so tasty. Perfect little selection of hummus, meat and extras. I didn't know that IOS existed Uptown, but I'll be sure to add it to my list of Uptown food options.  I loved getting to chat with Yelpers that I hadn't met before and catch up with the regulars.  \n\nAnd cheers to the Smores bar!! (Thank you again to Poprock for not catching me shoving the whole marshmallow in my mouth...)\n\nHappy Holidays all!!  Lookout, 2015!"
"1","This place was just okay for me. It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So, I was very excited when I heard one had opened here! \n\nWhen I looked at the menu, it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived, I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out, but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  \n\nOverall, the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat, fry some bacon, melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes! Oh, my friend got a strawberry milkshake that was OK too. \n\nI wasn't too impressed so I may only return to see if my first experience was just bad or if a friend forces me."
"1","Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience.  Highlights:\n\n- $10 unexpected parking fee \n\n- Before we entered we were told by staff that food or drinks were not allowed on the premises, \""No exceptions.\"" I learned that, actually, both were allowed, but only if you paid for them inside. When we did purchase food and drinks ($40 worth), we were never advised that we could not proceed into other domes with said food and drinks.\u00a0 At dome 3, the staff told us we had to throw away everything,\u00a0 which included the souvenir cups, before we could proceed (it's worth noting the concession stand is RIGHT NEXT TO dome 3). \n\n- The work I put in to pre register for the event (a laborious task due to a poor Web experience) was useless because the kiosks to activate/link profiles to your provided band didn't work. Also, I learned from a manager that the wristbands that were sent to AZ were not the ones they originally tested the experience with.  The wristbands did not work at all,\u00a0 and they we're eventually taken away from us by staff outside the level 3 dome because \""they're vey defective,\"" as one employee told me. \n\n- Staff activated each interactive game with random bands (I guess some actually worked?)...But this seemed to cause issues with the sensors that read body height; all but one of the games functioned poorly.\n\n- None of the 3D features worked,\u00a0 and we were told they would not work until Tuesday (3 days after our purchased event date). Very upsetting considering 3D features were advertised as part of the Marvel Experience. \n\n- Waiting times to enter domes were extreme (it took our group 40 minutes to enter the the Level 3 dome because the staff said they were fixing technical issues). Another 30 min for the 4D. Btw, why was it considered 4D if I'm watching a 1D movie on a big screen (no 3D glasses here), while sitting on a motion seat? \n\n- At the end of the event,\u00a0 I was asked by a staff member how was my experience.\u00a0 I gave my candid feedback and his reply literally was,\u00a0 \""Well, at least you didn't pay $180 bucks per ticket like some other people.\"" Because...that's supposed to make me feel better? \n\n- Sidebar: Is it just me or did I not see one piece of merchandise in the shop that featured a female character (even though they were featured in the videos throughout the experience). Male characters only for sale. That doesn't seem very balanced.\n\n- Further frustrated,  I asked who is on site to manage the whole experience.  I was told it depends... There's someone managing VIP, food, tickets,  and technology.  I asked for anyone who can make changes.  Strangely,  they send me to the ticketing manager.  When I provided my feedback I learned: no one really knows who or to what extent staff was trained (some staff admitted to me they hadn't been thru the experience), the wrong bands were sent to AZ, there isn't time for anything to fix things because \""we go from 9 am to 11 pm everyday and there's no time to figure anything out,\"" AZ was more of a \""test ground,\"" and the 3D won't be fixed until Tuesday,  after someone is flown in to fix it. \n\n- If you want a refund (I'm sure you will), I learned you have to request it through TicketMaster.\n\nBoo."

"2","Items Selected:\nChocolate Cinnamon Horn\nSmall Cinnamon Crunch Cronut\nBlueberry Fritter\nBlueberry Frosted Cake\nApple Cinnamon Bear Claw\nCinnamon Crunch Hole, Glazed Hole, Powdered Sugar Hole\n\nA new year and a new favorite, the second of back-to-back weeks at Ace Donuts again showed the high quality of the new bakery's goods and this time opting for items not available on my first visit it was a truly excellent quintet that kicked of 2015 - the soft ring beneath blueberry frosting eating more like butter-cake than a doughnut while the fritter and cronut again shined despite selecting smaller versions and different constituents.  More than enough to share, but so good that one may not want to, it was largely due to my early hour of arrival that the Jumbo Bear Claw stuffed with ample amounts of cinnamon apples outshined any similar pastry in the city and although the combination of rich chocolate and substantial notes of cinnamon may not appeal to every palate the crispy exterior and soft insides of the gnarly horn was a veritable cornucopia of flavor, the warm delivery making the aromatics even more impactful and the chocolate just messy enough to justify the use of a fork and knife.\n\nUndoubtedly the best all-around doughnuttery in Las Vegas - Artisan, Old School, or Otherwise."
"1","Expensive lunch meals.  Fried pickles were good.  Waitress messed up 2 orders out of 4.  Don't think I'll return.  Asked for no cheese waitress joked extra cheese, then brought my meal with cheese.  Better places to eat in area."
"1","Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful."
"1","I have been using this company for 11 months.  Ryan would come out every other week and do what he needed to be done. Very little was required as I have desert landscaping and pretty much maintained it myself.  Just needed blowing and general light cleanup.  Ryan was very thorough.\nThen his brother, I believe, would  come out.  I would have to watch him as if I was not looking, it would be a pretty much \""hit and run\"" literally.\nI was expecting them Friday.  No show, no call as they never call when they cannot make it.  I have to call them and ask where they are or if they are coming.   Finally a text back saying they will be there Monday as they are running late.\n\nMonday comes and again no call no show.  I texted them...no answer...I was very upset at this point as I asked if they would trim a tree that is coming into my yard from a neighbor.  Mind you, there is very little to do here...no grass...no weeds..no plants to constantly trim.  I felt that I asked them to trim a tree and they could not be bothered.\n\nI am extremely disappointed in this company as they start out fine and as it continues, they seem to take their customer's for granted.  NO COMMUNICATION...NOT EVEN A CALL WHEN THEY CANNOT COME.   \n\nSORRY RYAN, I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  AS A BUSINESS OWNER, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!!!"
